# Create a class called library with data attributes like acc_number, 
# publisher, title and author. The methods of the class should include
# a. read() â€“ acc_number, title, author.
# b. compute() - to accept the number of days late, calculate and 
# display the fine charged at the rate of $1.50 per day.
# c. display the data.
